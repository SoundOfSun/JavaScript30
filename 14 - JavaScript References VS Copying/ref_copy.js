// now here is the problem!

// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice();

// const captain = person;
// captain.number = 99;

// how do we take a copy instead?

console.log(person);

// --> Take a blank object, fill it with existing object, pass other things.

// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

// --> very shallow !!!

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
